# GraphQL

## Why we use graphQL

1. allow us to aggregate data from different resources: MongoDB, JSON file...
2. graphQL is a query language, but we actually write it as objects.
3. write complex queries easily.
4. In graphQL, we could get what we want without over-fetching like SQL.
   e.g. in SQL: select \* from table where id>100 => it selects all the data first and store in resultSet and then apply where condition to filter and get the final result.
