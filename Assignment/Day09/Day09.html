            Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
            called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a
            picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
            Here is a copy of the drawing.
            <br /><br />
            In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole,
            without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they
            sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-item content-2">
          <p>
            I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And
            after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first
            drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this.
            <br /><br />
            I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
            drawing frightened them.
            <br /><br />
            But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
            hat?"
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-item">
          <p>
            My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa
            constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not
            able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of
            a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They
            always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked
            like this.
            <br /><br />
            The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
            drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the
            outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history,
            arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up
            what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been
            disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing
            Number Two.
